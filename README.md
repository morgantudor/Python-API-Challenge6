# Python-API-Challenge6

Challenge 6 homework

Description:

This activity analyzed over 500 cities around the world to investigate weather patterns as they approach the equator. Relationships were drawn between latitude and max temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity for each city. Linear regression models were made and analyzed to see what relationships were correlated and backed by data, if any. Then this data was filtered down to find ideal vacation cities and hotels were found for each city meeting that ideal criterion. This activity utilized python coding, visualization with MatPlotLib, and API requests.
